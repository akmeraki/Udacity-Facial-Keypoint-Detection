## Project Overview

Welcome to the Computer Vision capstone project in the AI Nanodegree program! In this project, youâ€™ll combine your knowledge of computer vision techniques and deep learning to build and end-to-end facial keypoint recognition system. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on any face and are used in many applications, from facial tracking to emotion recognition. Your completed code should be able to take in any image containing faces and identify the location of each face and their facial keypoints, as shown below.

### Environment

1. Clone the repository, and navigate to the downloaded folder.
```
git clone https://github.com/udacity/AIND-CV-FacialKeypoints.git
cd AIND-CV-FacialKeypoints
```

2. Create (and activate) a new environment with Python 3.5 and the `numpy` package.

	- __Linux__ or __Mac__: 
	```
	conda create --name aind-cv python=3.5 numpy
	source activate aind-cv
	```
	- __Windows__: 
	```
	conda create --name aind-cv python=3.5 numpy scipy
	activate aind-cv
	```

3. Install TensorFlow.
```
pip install tensorflow-gpu
```

4. Install a few required pip packages (including OpenCV).
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Switch [Keras backend](https://keras.io/backend/) to TensorFlow.
	- __Linux__ or __Mac__: 
	```
	KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow python -c "from keras import backend"
	```
	- __Windows__: 
	```
	set KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow
	python -c "from keras import backend"
	```
